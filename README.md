# IT635Project
This Repository contains files for the IT635 Project

For this Project I used SQLlite to create a simple database for my carrental company
The database contains the ID, Make, Model, Year and Class of the vehicles. 

## Installation

I created the database using
the SQLlite command line interface and I uploaded the database to github so cloning can be possible.

## Usage

To view the database you can use any command line utility to bring the database up. You will then be
able to pass some sql commands through the database to view the data. On my PC, I have created a folder
for SQL databases to keep them all in one place. When I open the command line interface, I change the
directory into that specific folder in order to open the database.
